echo "Error while compiling vertex shader. Info log:"
echo "ERROR: 0:1: '' : version '999' is not supported"
echo ""

echo "✅ AFTER (new behavior with enhanced logging):"
echo "====== SHADER COMPILATION ERROR ======"
echo "Shader: vertex (shaders/default.vert)"
echo "Error: Compilation failed"
echo "Full compilation log:"
echo "ERROR: 0:1: '' : version '999' is not supported"

echo "✅ IMGUI FALLBACK BEHAVIOR:"
echo "Failed to compile ImGui shaders with GLSL version #version 410 core, trying fallback..."
echo "Failed to compile ImGui shaders with GLSL version #version 330 core, trying fallback..."
echo "ImGui shaders compiled successfully with GLSL version: #version 330"

echo "✅ USER-FRIENDLY ERROR DIALOG:"
echo "Failed to initialize graphics system. This may be due to outdated graphics drivers or unsupported GPU."
echo ""
echo "Please ensure:"
echo "- Your graphics drivers are up to date"
echo "- Your GPU supports OpenGL 2.1 or higher" 
echo "- GLSL 120 or higher is supported"

echo "✅ SHADER PROVIDER STATISTICS:"
echo "Failed to compile shader 'mandelbrot': Failed to compile shader fragment (shaders/mandelbrot.frag): ERROR: version not supported"
echo "Successfully loaded 5/6 shaders"
echo ""

echo "✅ KEY IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "1. ✓ Full shader compilation errors logged to console"
echo "2. ✓ Shader names and file paths included in error messages"
echo "3. ✓ Automatic GLSL version fallback (410→330→150→140→130→120)"
echo "4. ✓ User-friendly error dialogs with actionable advice"
echo "5. ✓ GPU/driver requirements documented in README"
echo "6. ✓ Graceful degradation when some shaders fail to compile"
